    <h1>Indiana Jones</h1>

    <p class="note">From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones">Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a></p>

    <p><strong>Dr. Henry Walton "Indiana" Jones, Jr.</strong> is the title character and protagonist of the Indiana
        Jones franchise. George Lucas created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials. The
        character first appeared in the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, to be followed by Indiana Jones and the
        Temple of Doom in 1984, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade in 1989, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles from
        1992 to 1996, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in 2008. The character is also featured in
        novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also featured in several Disney theme parks, including
        the Indiana Jones Adventure, Indiana Jones et le Temple du Péril, and Epic Stunt Spectacular! attractions.</p>

    <p>Jones is most famously portrayed by Harrison Ford and has also been portrayed by River Phoenix (as the young
        Jones in The Last Crusade) and in the television series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles by Corey Carrier,
        Sean Patrick Flanery, and George Hall. Doug Lee has supplied the voice of Jones for two LucasArts video games,
        Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, David Esch supplied his
        voice for Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, and John Armstrong for Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings.</p>

    <p>Jones is characterized by his iconic accoutrements (bullwhip, fedora, satchel and leather jacket), wry sense of
        humor, deep knowledge of ancient civilizations and languages, and fear of snakes.</p>

    <p>Since his first appearance in Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones has become one of cinema's most famous
        characters. In 2003, the American Film Institute ranked him the second greatest film hero of all time. He was
        also named the 1st Greatest Movie Character by Empire magazine. Entertainment Weekly ranked Indy 2nd on their
        list of The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture. Premiere magazine also placed Indy at number 7 on their
        list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time. </p>

    <p>A native of Princeton, New Jersey, Indiana Jones was introduced as a tenured professor of archeology in the 1981
        film Raiders of the Lost Ark, set in 1936. The character is an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial
        treasure hunters and pulp action heroes. His research is funded by Marshall College (named after producer Frank
        Marshall), a fictional college in Connecticut, where he is a professor of archaeology. He also attended the
        University of Chicago.</p>

    <p>In this first adventure, he is pitted against Nazis commissioned by Hitler to recover artifacts of great power
        from the Old Testament (see Nazi archaeology). In consequence, Dr Jones travels the world to prevent them from
        recovering the Ark of the Covenant (see also Biblical archaeology). He is aided by Marion Ravenwood and Sallah.
        The Nazis are led by Jones's archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named René Belloq, and Arnold
        Toht, a sinister Gestapo agent.</p>

    <p>In the 1984 prequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to
        free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty Thuggee cult. He is aided by Short
        Round, a young boy, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw).</p>

    <p>The third film, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original,
        reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody, a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now
        teaches at Barnett College), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous
        Nazi mystics, this time trying to find the Holy Grail. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back
        story to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a bullwhip, the scar on his
        chin, and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that "Indiana" is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he
        took from the family dog. The film was a buddy movie of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, Henry Jones, Sr.,
        often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, Indiana Jones and the Last
        Crusade was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good plot element to drive the next
        installment.</p>

    <p>The 2008 film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is the latest film in the series. Set
        in 1957, 19 years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against Soviet agents
        bent on harnessing the power of an extraterrestrial device discovered in South America. Jones is aided
        in his adventure by his former lover, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), and her son—a young greaser named
        Henry "Mutt" Williams (Shia LaBeouf), later revealed to be Jones' unknown child. There were rumors that
        Harrison Ford would not return for any future installments and LaBeouf would take over the Indy
        franchise. This film also reveals that Jones was recruited by the Office of Strategic Services during
        World War II, attaining the rank of Colonel in the United States Army. He is tasked with conducting
        covert operations with MI6 agent George McHale against the Soviet Union.</p>

    <p>In March 2016, Disney announced a fifth Indiana Jones film in development, with Ford and Spielberg set
        to return to the franchise. Initially set for release on July 10, 2020, the film's release date was
        pushed back to July 9, 2021 due to production issues.</p>

    <p>Indiana Jones is featured at several Walt Disney theme park attractions. The Indiana Jones Adventure
        attractions at Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea ("Temple of the Forbidden Eye" and "Temple of the Crystal
        Skull," respectively) place Indy at the forefront of two similar archaeological discoveries. These two
        temples each contain a wrathful deity who threatens the guests who ride through in World War II troop
        transports. The attractions, some of the most expensive of their kind at the time, opened in 1995 and
        2001, respectively, with sole design credit attributed to Walt Disney Imagineering.
        Disney did not originally license Harrison Ford's likeness for the American version;
        nonetheless, a differentiated Indiana Jones audio-animatronic character appears at three points in both
        attractions. However, the Indiana Jones featured in the DisneySea version does use Harrison Ford's
        likeness but uses Japanese audio for all of his speaking parts. In 2010, some of the
        Indy audio-animatronics at the Disneyland version were replaced with ones resembling Ford.</p>

    <p>Disneyland Paris also features an Indiana Jones-titled ride where people speed off through ancient ruins
        in a runaway mine wagon similar to that found in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Indiana Jones
        and the Temple of Peril is a looping roller coaster engineered by Intamin, designed by Walt Disney
        Imagineering, and opened in 1993.</p>

    <p>The Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! is a live show that has been presented in the Disney's
        Hollywood Studios theme park of the Walt Disney World Resort with few changes since the park's 1989
        opening, as Disney-MGM Studios. The 25-minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a
        feature film production, and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show. Stunt artists
        in the show re-create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the Raiders of the
        Lost Ark films, including the well-known "running-from-the-boulder" scene. Stunt performer Anislav
        Varbanov was fatally injured in August 2009, while rehearsing the popular show. Also at Disney's
        Hollywood Studios, an audio-animatronic Indiana Jones appears in another attraction; during The Great
        Movie Ride's Raiders of the Lost Ark segment. </p>
